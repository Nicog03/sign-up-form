# Sign up form

## About the project

This project was made with the intent of practicing the structure of a web form, as well as implementing some cool animations and also some good practices on the creation of a form.

It was made as the conclusion for the Forms section on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

# Features

## Responsiveness

The responsiveness of the page was something that i really wanted to work on, matter of fact, this was probably my first time messing around with the tag `@media` inside the CSS file. But overall, being able to use one of my apps on a phone screen was something really nice, and i really look foward to doing it more often (or even implementing this feature on older projects).

## Input Animations

The animation were something that i often try to implement whenever i am working with input elements. This one in specific turned out to be one of my proudest creations. Through the use of _pseudo-classes_ and _pseudo-elements_, i was able to accomplish some rather satisfying animations on the input elements.

## Password Similarity Check

The password check is something that still needs to be worked on... i mean, it works, but there's so many more things that i wanna implement on it, that i cannot say that it is done. It was made using JavaScript, by comparing both password strings. The feature that i am most proud on this password check is the fact that it decides when to output the error message based on the typing of the user, basically: if you're typing it does not display the error, it is only after _exactly_ 0,5s of not typing that it display the error.

# Possible improvements

This project is pretty simple, and one of my specific future improvements is to try and make it as interesting as possible. So, some of the things i still plan to work on are:

- Improve how the images are displayed, make them more appealing to the eye;
- Implement a better password similarity check UI and algorithm;
- Implement a google login API.
